# Absenteeism Case Study

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing absenteeism from work using machine learning techniques. The entire process is divided into several key sections:

## Data Preprocessing

In this initial phase, the 'Absenteeism_data.csv' file is preprocessed to prepare it for use in a machine learning algorithm. This step involves cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. Detailed explanations and tutorials are provided to guide through the preprocessing process.

## Machine Learning

The preprocessed data is then utilized to develop a logistic regression model. This model aims to predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work. Various machine learning tools and techniques are employed in this stage to build and evaluate the model. The final outcome is stored as a Python module named 'absenteeism_module' for further analysis.
