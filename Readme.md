# Absenteeism Case Study

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing absenteeism from work using machine learning techniques. The entire process is divided into several key sections:

## Data Preprocessing

In this initial phase, the 'Absenteeism_data.csv' file is preprocessed to prepare it for use in a machine learning algorithm. This step involves cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. Detailed explanations and tutorials are provided to guide through the preprocessing process.

## Machine Learning

The preprocessed data is then utilized to develop a logistic regression model. This model aims to predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work. Various machine learning tools and techniques are employed in this stage to build and evaluate the model. The final outcome is stored as a Python module named 'absenteeism_module' for further analysis.

## Loading the 'absenteeism_module'

In this section, the 'absenteeism_module' is loaded, and its methods are utilized to obtain predictions based on the developed model. This allows for the practical application of the trained model on new data.

## Analyzing Predicted Outputs in Tableau

Finally, the predicted outputs from the model are analyzed using Tableau. Visualizations are created to explore dependencies between different input variables and gain insights into the factors influencing absenteeism. These visualizations provide valuable information for decision-making and further exploration of the dataset.
